# Virtuace Code Challenge

We have had a sudden corruption error in our git repository and have lost a number of iterations on our application! We need to you rebuild the missing parts of our app.

Please spend only up to two hours implementing the frontend and backend for the images feature. **Important** — when you're done:

- Remove the `node_modules` folder
- Remove `dist folder` from server folder
- Zip up this directory
- Edit the last section of this README file with a short blurb telling us what tradeoffs you made (if any) and how you might improve your solution and any other outstanding thoughts.
- Submit it back to us (josh.miller@virtuance.com)

## Task details

- Users should be able to see all of their images in a grid format with the name of image being an editable text box
- Users should be able to edit the name of their image and have that update on the server
- For the simplicity of this exercise we are only using an in memory object on the backend where we would normally be using a DB.

## Running locally

- `npm i` — Installs dependencies
- `npm start:frontend` — Starts the frontend code
- `npm start:server` — Starts the server

You can run each of these commands in different terminals

## Tradeoffs and follow-ups
